# 1. Introduction

## 1.2 Project Goals

### 1.2.1 Create a Cloud-Native, Microservices-Based MVP Application
- **Objective**: Develop a basic but functional application that follows a microservices architecture, with each service containerized individually.
- **Purpose**: Enable the demonstration of microservices concepts, containerization, and deployment practices in a realistic but simplified setup.

### 1.2.2 Replicate the Development Lifecycle from Laptop to Production
- **Objective**: Build the application locally on Apple silicon, then deploy it to a Single Node OpenShift (SNO) instance for staging, and finally to a ROSA instance as a production environment.
- **Purpose**: Show the process of moving code through various environments, addressing architecture-specific challenges, and maintaining consistency across setups.

### 1.2.3 Establish CI/CD Pipelines to Automate Deployment
- **Objective**: Implement CI/CD pipelines to streamline application deployment from development to production.
- **Purpose**: Introduce continuous integration and continuous deployment practices, enhancing workflow efficiency and minimizing manual intervention.

### 1.2.4 Incorporate GitOps Practices for Environment Management
- **Objective**: Use GitOps (with Argo CD) for version control-based deployments, automating application state management across environments.
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate GitOps methodology, where configuration files stored in Git serve as the single source of truth, facilitating declarative deployments.

### 1.2.5 Implement Environment-Specific Tagging and Versioning
- **Objective**: Introduce environment tagging (e.g., local, staging, production) and versioning for the application, aligning with the stages of deployment.
- **Purpose**: Track the application’s state at each stage, document version history, and set up consistent deployment practices that mimic real-world processes.

### 1.2.6 Demonstrate Best Practices for Cross-Architecture Compatibility
- **Objective**: Ensure that the application is compatible with both Apple silicon and x86 architectures.
- **Purpose**: Highlight best practices for developing cross-architecture applications, especially around building and testing in diverse environments.

### 1.2.7 Create Documentation for Learning and Reusability
- **Objective**: Document each step thoroughly to create a learning resource that can help beginners understand cloud-native development and deployment.
- **Purpose**: Provide a clear, accessible guide for those without a software background to follow along, understand the concepts, and apply them to their own projects.
